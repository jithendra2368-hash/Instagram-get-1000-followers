# Instagram Phishing Awareness Simulation

⚠️ **FOR AUTHORIZED SECURITY TESTING ONLY**

A Flask-based tool that demonstrates how phishing pages work by simulating an Instagram login page. Built for cybersecurity awareness training and authorized red team exercises.

## How It Works

1. User opens the login page
2. User enters their Instagram username and password
3. User clicks "Get 1000+ Followers"
4. Credentials are captured and saved to `captured_creds.txt`
5. User is redirected to a "Congratulations" page showing +1000 followers

## Installation

```bash
pip install flask
python main.py
